# chatBot
Python Messenger Simulator

Description:
  This is a Python 2.7 script that simulates an instant messenger chatBot. Remember the days before Facebook and even MySpace? When I was a teen, we used AIM. This is a spare-time project that is far from complete, but is designed to simulate the AIM experience. 
  
Instructions:
  - There is still a lot to be done on this project, and plenty of bugs. For now, I have included a short demonstration video of the progress made so far. Copy and paste the link to view:
